# Gradient Descent Lab

This repository contains an in-depth exploration of the Gradient Descent algorithm with a focus on univariate or single-input variable linear regression. 
The lab includes detailed explanations, mathematical formulations, and code implementations.

## Key Highlights:

- **Algorithm Explanation:** Understand the workings of Gradient Descent, exploring both its theoretical foundations and practical implementations.
- **Cost Function Optimization:** Witness how the cost function decreases iteratively, aiming to find the global minima using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
- **Contour Plots:** Visualize the optimization process through contour plots, gaining a better intuition of how Gradient Descent operates.
- **Learning Rate Concept:** Grasp the concept of the learning rate and learn how to judiciously choose it for a smooth convergence of the algorithm.

## Usage:

This lab notebook is adapted from the Machine Learning Specialization course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 
It is highly recommended to refer to the original course for a comprehensive understanding of the material.
